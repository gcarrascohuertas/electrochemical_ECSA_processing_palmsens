# Electrochemical ECSA fit tools in Python - PStrace (PalmSens) version

# Overview

Electrochemical surface area is one of the most important  parameters in electrochemistry. Unfortunately, experimental research of this material property is complicated due to  processing data time involved. 

This project aims to provide quick-tools developed in Python for ECSA data treatment. 
Main tools consist in obtain following parameters: 

- Area (cm2) for anodic analysis.
- Area (cm2) for cathodic analysis.
- Stacked plots associated to ECSA analysis.
- Randles–Ševčík plots associated to ECSA analysis for cathodic and anodic peaks.
