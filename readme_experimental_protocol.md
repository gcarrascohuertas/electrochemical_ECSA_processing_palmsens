# About

Here I provided a short-guide of experimental acquisition data. I summarized the main things you need to take into account but [gcarrascohuertas]( https://github.com/gcarrascohuertas) is not responsible for the bad use of this guide and its consequences over materials and people involved. Please, be careful and document all steps you perform. 

# Electrochemical setup

First you need following materials in order to perform experiments:

- Three-electrode cell

    - Platinum mesh as counter electrode (CE)
    - Ag/AgCl/KCl (3.5M) as reference electrode (RE)
    - Your working electrode (WE). Here I used a a polished  [Glassy carbon electrode](https://www.basinc.com/products/MF-2012)   (GC, 3 mm diameter, BASI).

- Electrolyte
    - K<sub>4</sub>[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]  0.004 M (0.000004 mol/cm<sup>3</sup>) dissolved in 0.1 M KCl (D = 7.6Eâˆ’6 cm<sup>2</sup>/s)
